# To publish the snap, run 'snapcraft push easy-cli_<version>_<arch>.snap'

summary: Multi-platform utility to easily exchange text messages between devices.
description: |
  This is the CLI version (terminal only) client for EasyPush.
  EasyPush is a multi-platform and serverless (decentralized) utility to easily exchange text messages between devices through any given UDP port.
  No login or any account required! Not even an internet connection is necessary (as long as your devices are on the same local network).
  Run "easypush --help" for usage info.

grade: stable # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels, or 'devel' to release into development channels
confinement: strict # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots, or 'devmode' for development only
